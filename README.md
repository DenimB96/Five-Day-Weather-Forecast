# Five-Day-Weather-Forecast
A five day weather forecast is using the API Open Weather and local storage to save persistent data
## Instructions
When the user searches for a city, they're presented with the current and future conditions for the city and it is added to the search history. The current weather conditions for the city will include the name, date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, and the windspeed. The future weather is a 5 day forecast that displays the same information. When the user clicks on a city in the search history it redisplays the data for that city.
### Results
Using Bootstrap framework, Jquery, and the Open weather API the user can search for a city and get the current and future weather conditions which include the name, date, temperature, humidity, wind speed and UVIndex for each city. The forecast will display corresponding weather icons. Local storage will store data for previously search cities and add them to a list which can be clicked to reload city search.
